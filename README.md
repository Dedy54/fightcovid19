## The Idea Features and Technologies

The idea of ​​this game is from the corona virus Pandemic that happen in 2019 and countries in the world got the impact of the corona virus. . In this game I try to put some value about the corona virus, and set rules for the game that i called bye bye covid-19. 

1. Viruses will appear once a second:
Because corona viruses are very dangerous, this virus can multiply rapidly.
2. Emoji as people must avoid viruses:
This viruses will be very easy to transmit people to another people, thats why we need to avoid the viruses.
3. Days will return to 14 days :
Because this virus can survive for 14 days inside human body, every person affected by this virus must be isolated for 14.
4. Random emoji & background music:
I try to give a happy impression when dealing with this virus, with cheers in the background of the music. And i give emojis happy, sleepy, or wearing masks as people to safe and happy when dealing with this virus.

From the technology side here I use the 3 most important points. There are the SpriteKit framework, AVFoundation framework and the UIGestureRecognizer class.

This game used SpriteKit as a foundation. and then I also used UIGestureRecognizer as user input to move emojis to avoid viruses. Then to make the game sounds more interesting, I use AVFoundation to play background noise when the users playing the game.

Hopefully this game can entertainment user and we can also get away from covid-19.
    

## Rule Game

- This is simple game, user have to do is swipe emoji (people) away from the virus.
- if emoji got the virus, your heart will decrease 1, and days will be back to 14 days. Why 14 Days because virus can survive within 14 days. 
- if user can keep away emoji from virus during 14 days (display in second), game will stop and you win the game.
- if user canot keep away emoji from virus during 14 days (display in Second) or you don't have any heart, game will stop and you lose the game.
